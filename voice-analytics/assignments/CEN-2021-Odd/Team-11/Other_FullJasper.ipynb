cheerful\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01382.wav,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01383.wav,this is absolutely incorrect\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01384.wav,in the social conception of life it is supposed since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interest of the group\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01385.wav,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01386.wav,the man who wis controlled by moral influence axts in accordance with his own desires\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01387.wav,the basis of authority is bodily violence\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01388.wav,the possibility of a plying bodily violence the people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01389.wav,these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what costts it the army\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_0139.wav,she was waiting for the wood to buy the kettle when i come out mother\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01390.wav,the army has always been and still is the basis of power\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01391.wav,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything in court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power ar secure\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01392.wav,indeed it could not be otherwise\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01393.wav,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01394.wav,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being sanced through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01395.wav,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasted\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01396.wav,between the members of one sday subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seemed still less and the life of the state seems even more secure\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01397.wav,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggling conquest\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01398.wav,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01399.wav,but this justification is never more than temporary\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_014.wav,so there left milton\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_0140.wav,and bad when she's in a good temper\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01400.wav,internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression deserted by the authority over the dissentient individuals\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01401.wav,govern authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01402.wav,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest lemon beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden exs\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01403.wav,the most convincing examplef this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subdued by conquest\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01404.wav,so it has always been\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01405.wav,footeote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of a small number of their troops not only fails to discruve this position dut positively confirms it\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01406.wav,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer belong on pincatence men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased trength of the army\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01407.wav,the reason to which he gave expressions essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engaged swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontier are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the centre are stationed on the frontiers\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01408.wav,the meaning of ca previous speech put into plain language is that funsere needed not to rese his foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslave toiling masses\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01409.wav,and this abnormal order of thanks is maintained by the army\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_0141.wav,that an't but she'll be in when you gets back\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01410.wav,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiding their subcests by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslave subjects\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01411.wav,and so every government needs an army also to prodect its booty from its neighbour brigands\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01412.wav,this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out a hundred fifty years ago\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01413.wav,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defence against its subjects becomes a sort of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01414.wav,the despotism of the government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of the government increases with its internal despotism\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01415.wav,the rivalry of the european states and constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recoursed the universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers has obtained at the least possible expense\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01416.wav,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens had become their own impressors\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01417.wav,this inconsistency has become obvious and universal athor service\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01418.wav,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life the groups of persons\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01419.wav,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cuelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had met to avoid\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_0142.wav,i got a stiget said dicky sadly at best wee getting home\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01420.wav,but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting stripe with individuals of other states for strifed with neighbors\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01421.wav,the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorbe the greater part of the produce of labour which the army ought to defend\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01422.wav,the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life socialife vain and fruitless\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01423.wav,but the fin significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01424.wav,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01425.wav,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01426.wav,and for the sake of what am i making them\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01427.wav,i'm expected for the sake of a state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01428.wav,except with the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01429.wav,we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of envaromint and moral influence\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_0143.wav,i wouldn't go home not if i was you said the man\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01430.wav,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil dispose persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago as none whatever know\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01431.wav,except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication in sorn\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01432.wav,without the statemen would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01433.wav,this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01434.wav,the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state ait in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01435.wav,without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbours\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01436.wav,the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who mind end slavers\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01437.wav,and if defence against barbarous nations as meant one thousandth part of the troops now under onm would be amply sufficient with that purpose\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01438.wav,the power of the state far from being a security against the attycks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such a tax\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01439.wav,even looking at it practically waying that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the states no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageus than to revuse to do so\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_0144.wav,no said dickie oh no no annever\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01440.wav,to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not

disadvantages\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01443.wav,say you know something\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01444.wav,chris looked from an the complaited flashligkht to a car jack and spark

pursued\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01452.wav,he would have liked to get the job for jakie who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going and dust edged into the streets was not what chris had intended for ending the afternoon\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01453.wav,night's expression changed at what once to one of triumph but bris was only

the mirabelle\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01467.wav,he had never seen any one go into mister wooker's shop now he thought of that\n","OtherFullData/audio/file_01468.wav,how then did he live and what

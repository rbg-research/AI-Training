## Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv in ubuntu

[``venv``](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#venv)  (for Python 3) allows you to manage separate package installations for different projects. It creates a “virtual” isolated Python installation. When you switch projects, you can create a new virtual environment which is isolated from other virtual environments. You benefit from the virtual environment since packages can be installed confidently and will not interfere with another project’s environment.

## Create and Use Virtual Environments
### Create a new virtual environment
To create a virtual environment, go to your project’s directory and run the following command. This will create a new virtual environment in a local folder named `environments`:

```
python3 -m venv environments/[CUSTOM_ENV_NAME]
```
`venv` will create a virtual Python installation in the `environments` folder.

### Activate a virtual environment
Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to  `activate`  it. Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific  `python`  and  `pip`  executables into your shell’s  `PATH`.

```
source environments/[CUSTOM_ENV_NAME]/bin/activate
```
Here, virtual environment named ``myenv`` has been activated as shown below:

### Add the virtual environment to Jupyter as a kernel
Install ``ipykernel`` using `pip`:
```
pip install ipykernel
```
here, no virtual environment has been added till now as kernel as shown below:

Add the virtual environment to Jupyter as a kernel by executing following command
```
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=[CUSTOM_ENV_NAME]
```
Now, after refreshing, one can see that virtual environment named ``myenv`` has successfully been added after executing above command.

Verify the presence of kernel by
```
jupyter kernelspec list
```
list of kernels have been given below

### Removing the virtual environment kernel (Optional)
The added virtual environment kernel can be removed from jupyter as follows:
```
jupyter kernelspec remove [CUSTOM_ENV_NAME]
```
### Deactivating Virtual Environment (Optional)
The activated virtual environment can be removed by
```
deactivate
```
